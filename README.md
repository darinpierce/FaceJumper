# FaceJumper
DoodleJump type game project
This was my first mostly self-done pygame project. It is a game that randomly spawns platforms and you must ascend them or die (dramatic, I know). I got help with a few things from a youtube video when I got stuck, which is understandable as I was still learning the basics of pygame.
